This project was built for my final year project in college. It is an RPG fantasy style game titled, “King Slayer”. 
The game is set in a top-down 2D fantasy world. The protagonist, Egaras, is a wizard. He has seen the newly
appointed king cast a spell over one of his neighbours in the forest. The king plans to take
over the realm of the flaming valley with this spell by turning the population into skeleton
slaves. 

The language used to develop the game was in C#. It is developed for Windows, Mac and
Linux systems. It was developed using the game development platform, Unity (Unity, 2018).
Most of the art work was out sourced from the unity asset store (Assetstore.unity.com, 2018)
and the websites GameArt2D (GameArt2D, 2018) and GameDev Market (GameDev Market,
2018).

I was awarded a grade B1 for my effort.
